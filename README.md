# Internal Mission Statement:

There is an enormous untapped potential for problems to be solved and meaningful work to be done by pretty much everyone. There is also an enormous untapped potential for pretty much everyone to feel a fulfilment and purpose that is currently lacking in their lives. The mission of Abilitizer is to pair as many users with as many problems to solve in as optimally a fashion as can be invented and implemented.

Additionally so many things are chaos driven, the bar is set very low for the improvement of almost all systems.

The technique most widely used to solve problems today is for a person to decide that they can do a particular thing better than it is being done right now (classic e.g. the mousetrap), expend effort making their idea come true, maybe forming a company, paying contractors and manufacturers. An unfortunate amoutn of the time, it turns out that no one actually wants that thing. Or it succeeds and is nowhere close to the optimal solution, and more optimal solutions end up failing. Let's flip this on its head. Let's ask the community to come up with the problems that need to be solved instead. While it is true that people often think they want something that they don't actually want, this technique is at least better than what we currently have. Perhaps some day that will be solved as well by Abilitizer.



# Public (Shorter, Simpler, Non-Technical) Mission Statement:

Abilitizer helps its users achieve any goal by illuminating ways that they can overcome the obstacles standing in their way.



# How It Works:

## Optimally Aimed Order And Chaos

Expose users to problems. Most of the time try to align the users with problems they have demonstrated propensity or interest in. A small portion of the time (yet to be determined how small) expose them to problems that are unlikely relevent to them. Similar to the way stumbleupon.com accomplishes this.

## Teams

Some problems are too big for a single person. In this case the user who creates the goal or the volunteer who works on it can determine if different hats are needed. Ideally there will be a hat for assigning hats.

The goal is for users to try their hands at many different skills while focusing on a few specialties at the same time. This is not required, but it is incentivised.

Some problems will be specific to local areas. In this case, teams will need to be users that can meet achother IRL. Handle this dating site and uber style.

Users are going to try to game the system. Redundancy of moderators is a must to prevent this. Wikipedia style. Moderator will be an official hat that earns Karma just like any other hat. It is possible that so many users will want to be a moderator that the amount of Karma dolled out will be negligible. Another technique might be to randomly select moderators to review reported cases. Also, moderators will be randomly assigned to teams. The higher the stakes for a problem, the more important the moderators become.

I have absolutely no idea how team conflict resolution will work. Maybe have both sides present their arguments Priori style and then have the team, the team leader, a moderator, the originator of the problem, or the community in general step in and vote? How would tie-breakers work?

Teams might try to kill-steal Karma by kicking off a member right at the very end and replacing the member with someone who does very little of the actual work. This can be prevented by monitoring the rate at which users vote to remove other members and auditing/banning users when the rate is too high. Be careful about false positives. Balance thier rate with the rate at which users get kicked off teams, and with how new the users are that they voted to kick off. New users will be a higher rate of spam.

Bots are welcome. If a user creates a bot that actually fulfills the role of a certain hat, first of all that's awesome! Second the user has full rights to the Karma their bot earned. Bots that suck shouldn't be deployed in production or it will hurt the user's reputation because they will be kicked off of their team.

## Karma Currency

One of the goals of Abilitizer is to provide opportunity for its users to make a reasonable amount of income from the work that they do. Volunteer work is great and is a great way to start out solving problems, however some problems absolutely need capital for a chance to actually solve them.

One idea for how this could happen is with a (fake) Karma currency. If users believe in Abilitizer and donate money to it, the money will be distributed to the users who want to trade their Karma for real money. Karma is good for bragging rights. Maybe show a dollar value next to the user's Karma. Absolutely no shame in trading Karma for real money. This means that there are two ways to donate: time + skill and actual money. A user's score would be the combination of the Karma they own, and the total amount of work they have done.

The technical implementation of the currency will need to be very secure - consider using a distributed technique, blockchain or otherwise.

Some hats are more desirable than others. Some aren't desirable at all. The more users are willing to wear a particular hat, the less Karma it's worth. On the other hand, the more a user demonstrates their skill and ability at a particular skill, the more Karma they earn for performing that task. Let's call this the skill bonus. Skill bonus has a half-life of additional Karma, otherwise a user could focus entirely on one skill, not actually be that much better than others, and still make way more Karma.

There needs to be an easy way for teams to take the work that they have done and form real corporations without disrupting the intention of the goal or causing headaches. Streamlining this will be essential.

Karma is granted on a per-project basis.

One of the problems with the way charities are currently funded is that users think they intuitively know what the problems are that need to be solved. Often there are much more important problems that get ignored. A major goal of Abilitizer is to pair funding with real problems in as much of a real optimal way as is possible.

## Techniques

There are some skills that almost no one knows that almost everyone will find useful. Ideally these will be served to the user right once, only once, and right exactly as they need it. The user needs a way to refer to these tips/skills at any time. This is especially true with hats. When a user tries on a new hat, the community of users who have gone through the process of learning that hat will have some superb advice to pass down. A stack overflow style might be nice here.

In particular:

### Systems Analysis

Merge Edge Case into Abilitizer as a technique.

### Accountability

Shifting habits for self-improvement. Write today's date at the top left and draw a straight horizontal line under it. Write up to six things you would like to start doing or stop doing vertically along the left of the paper belomw the date and the line. At the end of each day, if you were successful, write a tally mark in the row of your goal. If you were unsuccessful, write an X.

Create a mobile app and web interface image upload so users can take pictures of their scorecards and translate their progress to the web.

Have users compete with their friends.

Give the user the ability to choose which are public and which are not.

Have a reporting feature to sort goals by the most/least common, difficult, rate of progress, etc.

## Priorities

Merge Priori into Abilitizer as a technique.

### Learning How To Learn

### Teaching How To Teach

### Communication Techniques



# Challenges:

Sort problems that need solving by importance in a fair way.

Utilize a problem dependence hierarchy tree which identifies problems that, once solved, allow other problems to be solved. Place this type of problem as proportionately higher priority.

Make solving problems as little work as possible.

Make solving these problems more fun, interesting, engaging, profitable, or even just plain likely (meaning it's not necessarily any of the others at first, it just happens at all) than other activities which generate less wealth to the world - especially focus on negative wealth generation. Ultimately the goal is for everyone to win.

Make everyone win all the time as much as possible.

Invent some sort of unit for good and bad to quantify problem priority?

Demonstrate self evident truths that inspire progress as much as possible. For example, for users who hate science, demonstrate the scientific method without labeling it. But let them believe whatever they want.

Spark compassion.



# Definitions:

## A fair way

In this order:

1. Minimize the magnitude and volume of bad.
2. Maximize the magnitude and volume of good.
